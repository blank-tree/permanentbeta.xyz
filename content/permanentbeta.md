## Introduction

This is a text on the internet. There are many like it but this one is mine;\
and yours;\
and everyones;\
ever changing;\
never finished.

I'm going on an adventure by my own choosing, to think and write about the landscape we're currently[^which is – when this project works in the intended way – now and in the future] in and the changes to our collective way of thinking about ourselves and the society[^In my case right now: the German speaking part of Switzerland in April 2019] we're part of.
Thinking back, the last two decades marked a drastically shift in the ways individuals and groups communicate with each other in a modern world. The expectation that everyone around us knows how to use (and misuse) the new tools of communication and information seem to unearth the ambiguity of the underlying concepts. With the implementation of this ambiguity into fixed systems – built by private companies – our society also seems to lose the agency to advance them in the future. This is a pessimistic view of [digitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization) and falls in line with the way of thinking of the [Swing Riots in the 1830s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Riots). One could think with the rhetoric used in news articles[^like the [Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica), the leaks surrounding [surveilance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) which are on an all time high since the [Snowden leaks in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Global_surveillance_disclosures), the list is long...] discussing pitfalls and setbacks – from the view of companies working in these fields – that an ["Orwellian Dystopia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian) is the only logical outcome. A worrying outlook, but in my humble opinion is this not the entire story and much of it is still in our – individual and collective – hands.\
Maybe these changes we're all currently experiencing give us an opportunity not just to reflect the new implementations of everyday interactions, but also to reflect the interactions and concepts they're based on.

This essay doesn't only give a highly subjective and opinionated view of the matters at hand, but also challenge the reader with a few obstacles along the way. The structure isn't fixed, the conclusions and views are ever shifting – even while you're currently reading this –, and over time, there will be additional changes I and hopefully other will supply to this essay. You can follow and judge the progression of this construct on the [Git-Repository](https://github.com/blank-tree/permanentbeta.xyz)[^a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) used and misused by programmers all over the world for sharing and collaborating on a variety of code based projects] or more specifically in the [commit history](https://github.com/blank-tree/permanentbeta.xyz/commits/master).

## The digital space

When we think about "space" we most commonly use it in two contexts: a physically existing space located in the world or a metaphorical one which often refers to time. I argue, that the digital space is like no other we have know before, because when you compare it, it doesn't behave like other spaces, encapsulated within themselves, but it penetrates all other spaces in our physical world. In 1967, Michel Foucault described his "thought experiment" of [Heterotopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotopia_(space)) like the following:

> "There are  also,  probably  in  every  culture,  in  every  civilization,  real places—places that do exist and that are formed in the very founding of society—which  are something  like  counter-sites,  a  kind  of  effectively  enacted  utopia  in which  the  real  sites,  all  the  other  real  sites  that  can  be  found  within  the  culture, are simultaneously  represented,  contested,  and  inverted.  Places  of  this  kind  are outside of all places, even though it may be possible to indicate their location in reality.  Because  these  places  are absolutely  different  from all  the  sites  that  they reflect  and  speak  about,  I  shall  call  them,  by  way  of  contrast  to  utopias, heterotopias."\
	[Michel Foucault: *Of Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias*](http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/foucault1.pdf)

The description Foucault provided seems to be fitting to a romantic description of the internet over forty years before it became part of our everyday life. One could argue, that the internet isn't "real" and only exists in a form of interpretation and translation an isn't bound to a physical space[^ at least, not anymore since the era of the "internet cafes" died in the early 2000s]
