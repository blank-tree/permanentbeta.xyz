## Introduction

This is a text on the internet. There are many like it but this one is mine;\
and yours;\
and everyones;\
ever changing;\
never finished.

I'm going on an adventure by my own choosing, to think and write about the landscape we're currently[^which is – when this project works in the intended way – any point in time] in and the changes to our collective way of thinking about ourselves and the society[^In my case right now: the German speaking part of Switzerland in April 2019] we're part of.\
Thinking back, the last two decades marked a drastically shift in the ways individuals and groups communicate with each other in a modern world. The expectation that everyone around us knows how to use (and misuse) the new tools of communication and information seem to unearth the ambiguity of the underlying concepts. With the implementation of this ambiguity into fixed systems – built by private companies – our society also seems to lose the agency to advance them in the future. This is a pessimistic view of [digitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization) and falls in line with the way of thinking of the [Swing Riots in the 1830s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Riots). One could think with the rhetoric used in news articles[^like the [Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica), the leaks surrounding [surveilance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) which are on an all time high since the [Snowden leaks in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Global_surveillance_disclosures), the list is long...] discussing pitfalls and setbacks – from the view of companies working in these fields – that an ["Orwellian Dystopia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian) is the only logical outcome. A worrying outlook, but in my humble opinion is this not the entire story and much of it is still in our – individual and collective – hands.\
Maybe these changes we're all currently experiencing give us an opportunity not just to reflect the new implementations of everyday interactions, but also to reflect the interactions and concepts they're based on.
