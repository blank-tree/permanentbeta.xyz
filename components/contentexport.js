			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>This is a text on the internet. There are many like it but this one is mine;<br/>
			and yours;<br/>
			and everyones;<br/>
			ever changing;<br/>
			never finished.</p>

			<p>I'm going on an adventure by my own choosing, to think and write about the landscape we're currently<sup><a href="#fn1-22793" id="fnr1-22793" title="see footnote" className="footnote">1</a></sup> in and the changes to our collective way of thinking about ourselves and the society<sup><a href="#fn2-22793" id="fnr2-22793" title="see footnote" className="footnote">2</a></sup> we're part of.
			Thinking back, the last two decades marked a drastically shift in the ways individuals and groups communicate with each other in a modern world. The expectation that everyone around us knows how to use (and misuse) the new tools of communication and information seem to unearth the ambiguity of the underlying concepts. With the implementation of this ambiguity into fixed systems – built mostly by private companies – our society also seems to lose the agency to advance them themselves in the future. This is a pessimistic view of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization">digitization</a> and falls in line with the way of thinking of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Riots">Swing Riots in the 1830s</a>. One could think with the rhetoric used in news articles<sup><a href="#fn3-22793" id="fnr3-22793" title="see footnote" className="footnote">3</a></sup> discussing pitfalls and setbacks – from the point of view of companies working in these fields – that an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian">&quot;Orwellian Dystopia&quot;</a> is the only logical outcome. A worrying outlook, but in my humble opinion is this not the entire story and much of it is still in our – individual and collective – hands.<br/>
			Maybe these changes we're all currently experiencing give us an opportunity not just to reflect the new implementations of everyday interactions, but also to reflect the interactions and concepts they're based on. Grand shifts in society tended to discuss specific variables and rarely society in its entirety, but that is exactly what we're currently undergoing when we try to translate more and more aspects and interactions into the digital realm under the flag of efficiency, and the result is a deadening and confusion amongst our peers and ourselves.</p>

			<p>This essay doesn't only give a highly subjective and opinionated view of the matters at hand, but also challenge the reader with a few obstacles along the way. The structure isn't fixed, the conclusions and views are ever shifting – even while you're currently reading this –, and over time, there will be additional changes I and hopefully other will supply to this essay. You can follow and judge the progression of this construct on the <a href="https://github.com/blank-tree/permanentbeta.xyz">Git-Repository</a><sup><a href="#fn4-22793" id="fnr4-22793" title="see footnote" className="footnote">4</a></sup> or more specifically in the <a href="https://github.com/blank-tree/permanentbeta.xyz/commits/master">commit history</a>.</p>

			<p>Because of the previously described nature of this essay, I'm already providing my conclusion of the following paragraphs. Dividing opinions regarding the internet in dystopian or utopian camps misses the opportunity to think of something in between: The act of the translation into the digital realm itself. This act – combined with the fact that any practice of abstraction and/or translation has to deal with a certain amount of loss of information – offers a working surface to place critique which can lead to reflection on the concept being translated regardless if it's revering to the &quot;original&quot; concept or the newly installed digital one.</p>

			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>In the beginning, this essay was written by <a href="https://fernando-obieta.com">Fernando Obieta</a> in his second Semester at the <a href="https://zhdk.ch">Zurich University of the Arts</a> enrolled in the masters program <a href="https://www.zhdk.ch/en/degree-programmes/transdisciplinary-studies-73/transdisciplinarystudies">&quot;Transdisciplinary Studies in the Arts&quot;</a>.</p>

			<h2>The digital space</h2>

			<p>When we think about &quot;space&quot; we most commonly use it in two contexts: a physically existing space located in the world or a metaphorical one which often refers to time. I argue, that the digital space is like no other we have encountered before, because when you compare it, it doesn't behave like other spaces, encapsulated within themselves, but penetrates nearly all other spaces in our physical world. It acts like an additional layer within and spanning across, which can also be understood as an additional layer of society.
			In 1967, Michel Foucault described his concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotopia_(space)">Heterotopia</a> like the following:</p>

			<blockquote>
			<p>&quot;There are also, probably in every culture, in every civilization, real places—places that do exist and that are formed in the very founding of society—which are something like counter-sites, a kind of effectively enacted utopia in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted. Places of this kind are outside of all places, even though it may be possible to indicate their location in reality. Because these places are absolutely different from all the sites that they reflect and speak about, I shall call them, by way of contrast to utopias, heterotopias.&quot;<br/>

			<p>The description Foucault provided seems to be fitting to a romantic description of the internet over forty years before it became part of our everyday life. One could argue, that the internet isn't &quot;real&quot; and only exists in a form of interpretation and translation an isn't bound to a physical space<sup><a href="#fn6-22793" id="fnr6-22793" title="see footnote" className="footnote">6</a></sup> like ships or brothels, but to a certain extent the same specifications Foucault describes seem to fit to the world wide web.</p>

			<blockquote>
			<p>&quot;Heterotopias always presuppose a system of opening and closing that both isolates them and makes them penetrable. In general, the heterotopic site is not freely accessible like a public place. Either the entry is compulsory, as in the case of entering a barracks or a prison, or else the individual has to submit to rites and purifications. To get in one must have a certain permission and make certain gestures. [...]&quot;

			</blockquote>

			<p>The submission to these new forms of communication is becoming a requirement to stay relevant within society, with even jobs requiring digital application in fields which don't need this specific skillset in their practice. To a certain extend, the ability to navigate through the digital forms of communication and interaction became the new center piece our education is concerned and struggling with to give people the means to comprehend our world. But this tends towards the usage and not the understanding or reflections of these &quot;tools&quot;. If we follow the submission we're actively dividing our society into &quot;users of technology&quot; and &quot;absentees&quot;. The threshold that one has to overcome to communicate with someone for longer then just one or two interactions in person <strong>without</strong> – for example – a smartphone<sup><a href="#fn8-22793" id="fnr8-22793" title="see footnote" className="footnote">8</a></sup> and availability through instant messaging or e-mail, is larger in comparison than with someone who's using these tools like you right now. Maybe we're constantly peer-pressuring – without specifically intending to do so – other people to join our digital heterotopia of efficiency<sup><a href="#fn9-22793" id="fnr9-22793" title="see footnote" className="footnote">9</a></sup>.<br/>
			So maybe, the compulsory &quot;feeling&quot; that arises, that you're &quot;missing out&quot; when you're not part of this &quot;digital revolution&quot;, forces people to define a position towards this digital space. I argue, that the individual choice one makes isn't the interesting thing, but the nature of our time that it become part of our everyday discourse that one has to <em>make</em> a choice how one stands to the digital space.<br/>
			Do you have <em>Facebook, Instagram, GMail, Skype, WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram, Signal, Threema, YouTube, Netflix, HBO, Spotify, Apple Music, Dropbox, Reddit</em>... why not? It's so useful!<br/>
			Have you seen my <em>Instagram Story</em>?<br/>
			Have you seen what Elon Musk posted on <em>Twitter</em> this morning?<br/>
			Are you coming to the party I've invited you to on <em>Facebook</em>?<br/>
			Did you watch the newest episode of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; on <em>HBO</em>?</p>

			<p>Our private and social lives are more intertwined than ever before with these tools. They're telling us, that you're relevant and part of society if you're using them; if you're following the people you admire and know; if you're showing the world who you actually are; if you're telling your story.</p>

			<p>It can be argued, that the human &quot;need&quot; to receive, transfer and share information as a survival mechanism found its logical continuation in the internet. The efficient transfer from speech, to text in its physical form to a fluid accessible digital form divided in bits and bytes delivered to our screens is a causality follow by an ideology of constant progress as a society and species. But in this regard, I'm confused by what &quot;progress&quot; actually is: </p>

			<h2>Who is my avatar</h2>

			<p>Various science fiction writers described utopian or dystopian worlds in which the society in it is deprived of reflection on their guiding systems. Like in &quot;Brave new world&quot; by Aldous Huxley in which the actors of a society are pressuring each other to take the happiness-producing drug &quot;soma&quot;. When you compare this drug to the pressure of availability and representation on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram on which everyone is happy, everyone is successful and everyone is doing great things in their individual lives, we're practically already doing the same thing. We force upon our individual selves the pressure of capitalization and quantification of each and every aspect of our lives, to show our peers that we're worth the &quot;social capital&quot; that we represent. But the dissonance between our presented selves and how – we think – we are is an age old discussion in sociology and psychology also along the line of how we perceive ourselves. Social media gives us the means to do this in an orderly and structured fashion. You have the same amount of space like everyone else to fill up with as many of things that you see fit to &quot;correctly&quot; show us who you actually are – or you would like us to believe who you are.</p>

			<p>In his book &quot;Alienation and Acceleration&quot;[^], Hartmut Rosa argues that the promise of the moderne era is the autonomy to decide – individually and collectively – what self-determination is. How much power do we <em>want</em> to </p>
