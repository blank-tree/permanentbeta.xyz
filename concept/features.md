# features for PB

- commit history and display changes... with github
- the meaning of the paragraphs change over time / after reload
- paragraphs change their positions in the flow over time / after reload
- embed images, sources, videos, gifs... directly into the flow
- hide personal comments through interaction in different sections (maybe even in handwriting?)
- sound of static underlying the entire experience with changes on the different sections...?
